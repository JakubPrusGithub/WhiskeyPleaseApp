      "articleTitle": "Johnnie Walker",
      "articleDescription": "Johnnie Walker is a brand of Scotch whisky produced by Diageo in Scotland. It originated in the Scottish burgh of Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire. The brand was first established by grocer John Walker. It is the most widely distributed brand of blended Scotch whisky in the world, sold in almost every country, with annual sales of the equivalent of over 223.7 million 700 ml bottles in 2016. The fun fact is that Winston Churchill's favourite whisky was Johnnie Walker Red Label, which he mixed with a large amount of water.",

      "articleHistory": "The legendary, original John Walker was born on July 25, 1805, on Todriggs Farm, Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, Scotland. The farm was not far from Glasgow on the west side of the island. In 1819, John’s father died, and the family farm where little Johnnie had spent the first fourteen years of his life, was sold. Though he was still but a little lad of 15, the proceeds from the sale were used to purchase a grocery store inside Kilmarnock proper. After a short time apprenticing to learn his new trade, John took over full management of his thriving business.Even though his main trade was selling groceries, over time he became well known as the go-to supplier of tea, fine wines, and spirits. He sold all kinds of alcohol, including rum, brandy, and gin, but it was his own private label whiskey that gained him recognition in the region. Most shop owners of the day stocked single malts, with inconsistent taste and texture. Mr. Walker, being a savvy businessman, made his whiskey through blending, giving him the ability to maintain good flavor quality in every bottle. In 1833, John married Elizabeth Purves, who later gave birth to their first son, Alexander. John was known locally as a member of trade associations and the Freemasons. A major flood damaged many local businesses in 1852, and reports show that his entire stock was ruined. It took almost two years to rebuild the business, but afterward, the popularity of his signature blend continued to grow until his death in 1857. After his death, the family business was taken over by Alexander. Britain was at the center of the Industrial Revolution, and with the arrival of the railroad in 1843 on his side, Alexander Walker created a distribution network that shipped John’s whiskey worldwide. The first copyrighted blend, called “Old Highland Whisky,” hit the shelves in 1867. This recipe is a direct ancestor of what we know call Johnnie Walker Black Label. The company has continued to grow, of course, adding Blue, Double Black, Gold, and Platinum label Johnnie Walker to the line. Now among a portfolio of brands owned by a large international company, the whiskey is no longer distilled in Kilmarnock, and the original plant has been demolished. Though the facilities are gone, you’ll still find the resilient, Scottish spirit of the original Johnnie Walker in every sip.",

      "articleTitle": "Jack Daniels",
      "articleDescription": "Jack Daniel's is a brand of Tennessee whiskey. It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee, by the Jack Daniel Distillery, which has been owned by the Brown–Forman Corporation since 1956. Packaged in square bottles, Jack Daniel's \"Black Label\" Tennessee whiskey sold 12.5 million nine-liter cases in the fiscal year ending on April 30, 2017. Other brand variations, such as Tennessee Honey, Gentleman Jack, and Tennessee Fire products brought a total of 16 million cases for the entire Jack Daniel's family of brands.",

      "articleHistory": "It all started when Jack ran away from home after his mother and father had both died. Prior to his death, Jack’s father remarried, but Jack despised his stepmother and was taken in by a local preacher named Dan Call. Call began teaching Jack about distilling, and in 1875 Jack founded a registered distilling business with Call using money from his late father’s estate. Shortly thereafter, Call quit the business due to religious reasons, and Jack took over the ownership. In 1884, Jack Daniel purchased the land where the distillery is located today. He ran it until 1907, when he gave the distillery to his nephew, Lemuel “Lew” Motlow, since he never married or had children. Motlow operated the distillery for 40 years. In 1910, he challenged the law in a case that went to the Tennessee Supreme Court. Since a statewide prohibition was passed in 1910, the legal distillation of Jack Daniel’s in Tennessee was not allowed. The company then moved production to St. Louis, Missouri, and Birmingham, Alabama, but was not able to achieve the quality of whiskey that was produced in Tennessee. Both Missouri and Alabama were affected by similar prohibitions, and after several years of repeals and changes to the law, the distillery was finally up and running for business in 1947. While it is now legal to distill whiskey in Tennessee, the distillery is actually located in a dry county. This means that while the product can legally be produced, it cannot legally be sold. However, there is one exception, which is that Jack Daniel’s can sell one commemorative product. You can purchase Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel, or Old No. 7 at the distillery’s bottle shop. Free tours are offered daily at the distillery from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., except on Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day. After each tour, guests are served a small cup of lemonade, since the dry country prohibits any alcohol sales.",

      "articleTitle": "Ballantine's",
      "articleDescription": "Ballantine's is a brand of blended Scotch whiskey produced by Pernod Ricard in Dumbarton, Scotland. The Ballantine's flavor is dependent on fingerprint malts from Miltonduff and Glenburgie, blended with 50 single malts and four single grains. The brand has won many accolades and awards for its products. The world's second-highest-selling Scotch whisky has historically been strong in Southern Europe. Ballantine innovates while staying true to a heritage that dates back to 1827.",

      "articleHistory": "Ballantine's Scotch whisky can trace its heritage back to 1827 when farmer's son George Ballantine set up a small grocery store in Edinburgh supplying a range of whiskies to his clientele. In 1865 George delegated the store's operation to his eldest son, Archibald, while he opened a larger establishment in Glasgow. Here he concentrated on the wine and spirit trade, catering to clients that included the Hindu Royal Family. He also began to create his own blends. These inspired additional demand, drawing a second son, George junior, into the business. Trading as \"George Ballantine and Son Ltd\", the firm added a bonded warehouse and began to export their Scotch. George senior retired in 1881 and died 10 years later at age 83 with George junior taking over. Building on the reputation and goodwill of the \"Ballantine's\" name, the new owners focused on developing it as a brand for their blended whiskies. The internationally experienced Canadian distilling concern of Hiram Walker Gooderham & Worts acquired Ballantine's in 1937. The new owners' first task was to secure fillings, to which end the Miltonduff and Glenburgie Distilleries were purchased, and a massive new grain distillery – the largest in Europe – was built at Dumbarton. During the 1960s the company turned to Europe - at that time an unexplored market for Scotch whisky – and by 1965 had secured such a strong foothold there that it resolved to gear the home trade to supporting the overseas business. Strong distribution and the popularity of Scotch whisky in the mid-1980s were key influencers in growth. Ballantine's was named the number one brand in Europe and the third largest in the world in 1986 with the oldest product Ballantine's Finest. In Korea, Ballantine's is the clear number one in the super-premium category with its ever-popular Ballantine's 17 in addition to 21 and 30. In 1988, the Company became part of the global beverage conglomerate Allied Domecq. In 2002 the large Dumbarton Grain distillery was mothballed, with production shifting to the Strathclyde Grain distillery in the Gorbals of Glasgow. In 2005 Ballantine's was acquired by Pernod Ricard. Ballantines still maintain a large bonded warehouse complex in Dumbarton East and a bottling plant to the North of the town.",
