# WhiskeyPlease 🥃

WhiskeyPlease is an iOS application that introduces users to the world of whiskeys and allows them to create their own ranking list of liquors! It comes with 10 interesting articles about various whiskeys brands including their description, history, and ingredients. User can add their own reviews of whiskeys and view statistics about all reviews. All data is stored locally, offline, and safely. <br><br>

<h2> Concept 💡</h2>

As an young adult I became interested in the world of alcohols, especially whiskeys. That passion lead to creating simple, but useful application for beginners to discover new liquors and save their opinion. It took me about a month to finish this project and with that done I'm happy to finally present it and start using it! <br><br>
